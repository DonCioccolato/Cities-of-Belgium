Usage:
By running main.py (terminal command "python main.py"), the application starts. 
Entering a valid muncipality in the typing field (by either pressing enter or pressing the "Toevoegen" button)
will add this city to the right province and add to your progress on the map. 
The timer will stop when all muncipalities have been submitted.
The submitions are not sensitive to accents or capital letters, but are sensitive to hyphens instead of spaces.
Submitions are valid in Dutch and French for the cities in wallonia and brussels. Cities in Flanders are only valid in Dutch.
After submitting, there is an unfortunate 1 second delay due to having to save the map as a png before being able to show it.

Mandatory files for the app to work:
"Belgische_gemeenten.csv": database of belgian muncipalities
"Map_of_Belgium.svg": file which makes filling in the map possible
"empty_map.png": picture of empty map for initial loading
